                        A clever play on words from the game's inspiration: Geometry Dash. Trig Trot is an infinite size scroller 
                        where you have to dodge incoming spikes. Equpped with music, skins, title and end screen, this game shows 
                        what a few peolpe can do in a short amount of time.

                        The lexical analyzer takes a text file as input. It then parses out the file in tokens. 
                        Those tokens are checked character by character to determine what they represent in each line of code. 
                        The lexer can determine if you are using a keyword, identifier, comment, strings, numbers, and much more. 
                        It creates an output file to write the lexer's findings. Equipped with error fuctionality, this program 
                        specializes in using system read and write functions.

                        Steganography is the artform of encoding a hidden message into pictures. This program works on the BMP file 
                        structure. It takes a file as input and encodes a hidden message into it. You can also input a file and decode 
                        the message in it. This plays off the fact that each pixel changes by 1 bit to represent binary. That binary 
                        is translated into characters then strings to formulate a hidden encoded message.

                        The game is very simple to learn, if you don't know how to play, there is a how to play screen. 
                        The game uses random chance to determine who goes first then the gameloop is off.
