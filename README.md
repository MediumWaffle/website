Hi, thank you for taking your time to check out version 1.0 of my portfolio website.
Theres a few aspects of this webiste that may catch your attention

All of my header text is actually done with pictures using [flaming text](www.flamingtext.com).

### Slide Show Images
This is my first attempt at javascript. The idea was to originally have the pictures slide from the left of the screen and to the right, then repeat. However I found that it was actually very easy with the use of animations and keyframes. So to get my javascript in, i decided to do a simple automatic slideshow. All 3 pictures are slideshows on an automatic 3s time loop

### About me
Simple about me page, but one thing to keep in mind, the power of AI is real. This about me text was
wrote by Open AI. Everything on the page in terms of code and styling was done by me. 

### Accolades
This text of the project was also written by Open AI. I gave it a promt to write about my accolades and that was the outcome. The code was written by me. 

### Projects
These are the top 5 projects I have completed in the past few years. All projects have a link to the
repository. 

### Conatct Me
The contact me seciton uses transitions on the pictures to show that you can click them.
